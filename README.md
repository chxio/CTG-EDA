# CTG-EDA
with help of EDA finding out the cause for Unhealthy Fetal state

Data Set Information:
2126 fetal cardiotocograms (CTGs) were automatically processed and the respective diagnostic features measured. The CTGs were also classified by three expert obstetricians and a consensus classification label assigned to each of them. 
Classification was both with respect to a morphologic pattern (A, B, C. ...) and to a fetal state (N, S, P). Therefore the dataset can be used either for 10-class or 3-class experiments.

Attribute Information:
LB - FHR baseline (beats per minute)AC - # of accelerations per secondFM - # of fetal movements per secondUC - # of uterine contractions per secondDL - # of light decelerations per secondDS - 
# of severe decelerations per secondDP - # of prolongued decelerations per secondASTV - percentage of time with abnormal short term variabilityMSTV - mean value of short term variabilityALTV - 
percentage of time with abnormal long term variabilityMLTV - mean value of long term variabilityWidth - width of FHR histogramMin - minimum of FHR histogramMax - Maximum of FHR histogramNmax - # of histogram peaksNzeros - 
# of histogram zerosMode - histogram modeMean - histogram meanMedian - histogram medianVariance - histogram varianceTendency - histogram tendencyCLASS - FHR pattern class code (1 to 10) NSP - fetal state class code (N=normal; S=suspect; P=pathologic)
